<p>In 2013, we launched version 4.0 of the CC license suite and it is ready for anyone to use now to apply to their educational resources or other creative works.</p>

And just as importantly, what has stayed the same so that you don’t have to worry about changes to licenses you weren’t expecting? Lastly, I’ll go over some examples of organizations and institutions who have already upgraded to the 4.0 version of whatever license they were using.</p>
