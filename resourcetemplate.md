When you create your resource, delete any lines above that aren't applicable. Also delete all of the content below the front matter and replace it with whatever you'd like to appear on the resource page.

**title**

Self-explanatory. 50 characters or less.

**published**

True tells Jekyll to display the file.

**layout**

resource

**weight**

The weight ranking determines the order in which resources should appear on the ["All" page](http://resources.creativecommons.org/all/). There are four options:

1. "Core" CC content. Highly relevant to anyone looking for information on CC tools, regardless of expertise level.
2. Content that might be slightly more appropriate for a certain niche (e.g., educators) or assumes a certain expertise level.
3. Content that is designed for a specific use case. For example, something that only focuses on CC licenses as they relate to science or government.
4. Content on issues that touch indirectly on CC, or is highly tailored to a specific audience.

**featured**

[The homepage](http://resources.creativecommons.org/) can feature up to 16 resources. This is the highest quality stuff with the broadest audience. If you add a "featured" number to your resource, please change the numbers on the other featured resources accordingly. Or better yet, suggest the change as an [issue on Github](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-resource-archive/issues) and we can discuss it there.

**author**

The creator of the work, however he/she/it wants to be credited.

**license**

The license the work is under. Format as follows:
- CC0
- CC BY 2.0
- CC BY-NC 4.0
- CC BY-SA 3.0 US
- CC BY-ND 3.0 IT
- etc.

**image-full and image-thumb**

Image-full should be 500px * 375px. Image-thumb should be 200*150. Put in the "images" folder. Use the full title as the filename, separated by hyphens.

**topic**

The "string" for each relevant topic, separated by spaces. [Use the topics listed here](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-resource-archive/blob/gh-pages/_data/topics.yml).

**language**

The two-letter abbreviation for each language, separated by spaces. [Here's the list of languages currently in use](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-resource-archive/blob/gh-pages/_data/languages.yml).

**medium**

The string for the medium the work is in. Current options are print, video, website, course, and slides.

**permalink**

The title, in lowercase, with hyphens between each word. See example formatting.

**blurb**

The text that will appear below the thumbnail in the listing. 140 characters or less.

**repourl**

If the source files for the resource are available online, put the URL where they can be found here.

**downloadurl**

The URL where the resource can be accessed or downloaded. Use the most obvious URL. For example, if the project is hosted on Internet Archive, use the URL for the info page, not the direct download for the file.

**embed**

If the resource is embeddable (for example, a video or slides), paste in the iframe code, with no returns.
